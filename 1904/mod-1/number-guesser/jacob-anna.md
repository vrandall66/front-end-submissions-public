## Student: Jacob Ogren & Anna Goodwin
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Really great work on number of commits and commit messages
  * Good work on consistency with branch names as well
* Make sure buttons line up at the end of inputs (just double checking spacing)
* Good attention to detail on user flow
* Great error handling
  * How could I handle if a user types in the letter e?
* See how you can sync up the labels to the inputs using the for attribute (make it more accessible)
* Might include some more heiarchy in the recent guesses 
  * Only have one h1 for the title
* Great work using the template html tag
* Good organization of styles and alphabetizing properties within each class
* Good organization of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
* Assign only one event listener to a button or input, and then fire functions inside of that function
* How can we refactor error functions  like challenger1 and challenger2GuessError into one?
  * Same with addFeedback1andWinner and addFeedback2andWinner into one function using arguments and parameters.
* Careful not to use inline styles event in your template literals in JS
* Great use of event delegation with the delete functionality


### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
