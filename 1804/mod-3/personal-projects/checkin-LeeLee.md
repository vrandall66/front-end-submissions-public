## Project Name:
NOSA (personal project)


#### Check In:

#### Progress made?
Yasssss, got the fetch happening and the items fetched into the redux store.  Got React Router firing, and some slight UI.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
Testing

#### Next Steps?
Better UI, and things appending to the page.  More Components created for pathways and user sign-in implemented to the store.

#### What are your concerns (if any)
Getting the appropriate naming conventions between actions, reducers, props in store, etc.

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
Have all of the different pages created for all possible routes, properly navigable by clicking the appropriate buttons/NavLinks.  User signUp and Login, along with initial testing of all those things.
