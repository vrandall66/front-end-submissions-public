## Check In: 2

### Progress made? Create workout is fully functional and goes into store. Can play jog song on react player and convert all lengths to milliseconds. Local storage is completed.

### Deliverables? Still have to do testing. I'm still getting that weird jest error anytime I try to mount something.

### Next Steps? Testing, and getting setTimeout in place to make sure the timing functionality is working.

### I'm concerned about set timeout, and seeing how to make sure all the songs play at the correct time.

### Deliverables: 
• Testing
• Start working on styling
• Get preview working
• Play entire workout
• Add prop-types
