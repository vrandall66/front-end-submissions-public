### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all
  components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async
  functionality.

### Redux Architecture

* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary      application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for
  rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for
  undefined routes.
