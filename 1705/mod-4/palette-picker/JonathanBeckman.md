## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.

I was able to complete the basice functionality

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

I was able to add the functionality of editing the color value of a single color swatch on the main palette.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
- this is an array of the colors of a specific palette
[happy code](https://github.com/jbexx/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L62)
- this loops through that array and appends them to the main palette
[happy code](https://github.com/jbexx/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L146-L153)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Because it took me a while to figure out how to handle an array in a string in html

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jbexx/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L179-L190)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I'd like to have these event listeners inline but having to call e.preventDefault because these button are in a form kept me from doing that.  I suppose a point of refactoring would be to move the e.preventDefault into the function Im calling to have the event listeners as one line.

Anything else you wanna say!

This project isn't complete.  I lost a lot time preparing my app for demo night and therefore did not finish this project.  It intend to edit this PR when I finish over the weekend.
