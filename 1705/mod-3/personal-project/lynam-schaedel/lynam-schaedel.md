## Project Name: Do You. (where Personality meets Passion)

#### Contributors: Christie Lynam and Margo Schaedel

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch: Application offering personality testing for high school and college students (can expand to include any demographic) to help guide them in making educational and career choices. Students will learn what kinds of jobs that people with their same personality type enjoy and are good at. They will also be able to share this personality info with friends on social media. Possibility to extend app to include compatibility in love, work, and friendships.

### Deliverables
