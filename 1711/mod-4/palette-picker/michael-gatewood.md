# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/mngatewood/palette-picker/blob/4a5619f98649ca61faf5b72347094e3fb7646889/public/js/script.js#L32-L37)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I struggled.  But once it worked, I realized it was a fun struggle.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/mngatewood/palette-picker/blob/4a5619f98649ca61faf5b72347094e3fb7646889/public/js/script.js#L143-L151)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Alerts.  I would have preferred a more elegant solution, but I fell behind and had to move on.  I'm also not happy with my ability to throw, catch, and display useful errors.  Consequently, this code is full of compromise.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

[inspiration](https://dribbble.com/shots/3367417-Dribbble-jackpot)

I thought that it would be cool to have spinning reels that revealed one at a time like the above dribbble. So I designed my UI with a slot machine in mind.  Time did not allow to create the animations, but my design still follows the idea.
