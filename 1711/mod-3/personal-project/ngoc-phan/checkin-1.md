### Check-In-1

### Project Pitch:
This application will give the user the ability to search through recipes and favorite the recipes. After the user logs back in, they will have the ability to see which recipes they have favorited. They will also be given the ability to just search through random suggestions if they have nothing in mind. This app will be for those who wants a little bit of direction when it comes to planning or cooking their next meal. 

## Deliverables

### Github: https://github.com/nphan24/feed-me

### Order Of Attack:
- fetch and clean the data
- display random meals as cards
- display the picture and directions on how to cook on a different page when clicked
- be able to signin
- flash password and email does not match if there is an error
- be able to create an account
- flash that email already exist if one exist
- each recipe should have a favorites button
- be able to toggle favorites
- be able to search recipes by keywords
- tests
- local storage

### MVP: 
Be able to display recipes and its summary as well as favorite the recipes using react, reduz, router and a middleware.

### Nice To Haves: 
- Link the recipe to an actual video of how its done
- Search recipes by the country
- Have dietary information on each recipe
- Have pictures of every ingredient
- Break the recipes down according to ingredient type

### Biggest Challenges: 
Testing will be one of my biggest challenges. Getting more comfortable with redux as well as incorporating a middleware will also be a challenge. 

### Instructor Notes:

### Deliverables for next checkin:
* Setup Redux and Router - file structure and routes
* be able to make fetch, clean data, and store data in the store
* add linter
* start testing
* store structure - think about keeping things flat and try not to duplicate
* start builing out UI
