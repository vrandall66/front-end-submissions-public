## Project Name:
The Bar Builder

#### Check In: 1

#### Progress made?
* UI built
* React, Router, Redux connected
* API calls functional
* Filters functional
* Search functional
* Inventory functional
* Random recipe displays

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
* "What Drinks Can I Make" function currently stores recipes based on inventory, but do not display.  The recipes array is inclusive and includes every recipe that CAN be made with selected ingredients.  The list needs to be filtered to include only ingredients in inventory.

#### Next Steps?
* Complete What Drinks Can I Make functionality.
* Update/finish tests

#### What are your concerns (if any)
* How to ensure completeness of What Drinks Can I Make without scrubbing every recipe?
* Writing and passing tests

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
* Separate search result recipes and inventory recipes into separate routes
* Create headers for each route to identify page on screen
* Create functionality to use multiple filters at once
* Create relevance filters to display only relevant recipes based on ingredients required vs on-hand
* Style all components
