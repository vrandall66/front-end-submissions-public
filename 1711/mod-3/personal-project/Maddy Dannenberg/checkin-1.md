#### Order Of Attack
Phase 1 - Set up file structure, make initial API call, clean data, set up U.S. state map.

#### MVP
Input for user to log states and map with visual indication of what states have been completed. Ability to search for races in states still needed.

#### Nice To Haves
Log race time, distance, shoes worn, reflection; Map view and list view; Filter which states user has run a given distance in (ie marathon, 10k); search races by city and date range; Pin city ran was run in 

#### Biggest Challenges
Building a map with dynamic highlighted regions
