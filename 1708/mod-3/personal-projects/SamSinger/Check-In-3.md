## Project Name:
  Restaurant Randomizer

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch
  I love food!!! And I honestly don't have a tough time when it comes to deciding where I want to go but I do know people and have friends and family that have a difficult time deciding where they want to go especially in large groups. I want to create an interactive app that solves this problem and gives the user a simple easy to use experience with a random restaurant generator depending on the persons location with the further extension of creating user IDs that can also interact within groups who are connected to each other.

### Deliverables
in progress - have restaurants scoped to user's location
in progress - have API utlity tested.
              - utility looks great I think if you dedicated time to testing this it will look really good from an employer standpoint
complete - start rendering restaurants on the DOM
in progress - start the process of voting.

#### Stack:
  React, Router, Redux, FireBase,

#### APIs:
  Zomato

#### Order Of Attack

- Display message board
- Initial testing
- Geo-location
- Randomizer depending on location
- Display only 3 options
- Look into adding user log-in and profiles through Firebase

#### MVP
  Depending on the users location, click a button to generate a random list of 3 restaurants within the area.
  - App is well tested
    - mocking fetch
    - redux is tested
   - well styled.

#### Nice To Haves
  Creating a user vote system with an interactive live upvote system.

#### Biggest Challenges
  I'm not familiar with FireBase
  Learning how to create multiple user profiles that will interact with each other.
