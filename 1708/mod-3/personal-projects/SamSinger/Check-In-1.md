## Project Name:
  Restaurant Randomizer

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch
  I love food!!! And I honestly don't have a tough time when it comes to deciding where I want to go but I do know people and have friends and family that have a difficult time deciding where they want to go especially in large groups. I want to create an interactive app that solves this problem and gives the user a simple easy to use experience with a random restaurant generator depending on the persons location with the further extension of creating user IDs that can also interact within groups who are connected to each other.

### Deliverables
