Project Name: Love-15;
Check In: 1
Progress made? User can search for courts, User can create account or log in, user can go to separate create account page. Current components are tested.
What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin? None.
Next Steps? Implement log in and createAccount message. Start adding styling. I may implement local storage to save account info.
What are your concerns (if any): Finding a good design. Building a back end(if I get there).
Deliverables for next checkin: appropriate feedback for createAccount and log in. Add customize account component. Have some type of solid design implemented.
