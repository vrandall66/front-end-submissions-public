## Project Name:
qwwickbiit

#### Check In: 2


#### Progress made?
I have the yelp data that I need, Google map api is working and rendering a map with markers. Layout decisions have been made. I have built out a backend to store users, I just need to implement it into my app.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
I think everything is complete from last check-in.

#### Next Steps?
Routing for each component, fix fetch calls on page load so that you don't have to click submit to fetch restaurants. Start testing.

Solve github issue, fix api call for setlist, create backend repo

#### What are your concerns (if any)
Do I need to break anything out of map in terms of testing? I will not be testing anything npm related. How will I deal with load times and rendering in order to make a fluid experience. How will I filter and will a new fetch call be made when a fitler is selected.

Not enough time if I need to build backends into both api requests

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

[] Find an API that can pull setlists into the browser
[] Get those shows (or similar) appearing on the page
[] Spend some time working on the UI
