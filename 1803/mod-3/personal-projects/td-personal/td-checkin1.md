## Project Name: BBQ Tracker

#### Check In 1

#### Project Pitch
BBQ tracking app. The app will be able to find local barbecue via the yelp api. The user will be able to filter by style, save restaurants to try later, and keep track of barbecue that they have tried. At some point I would like to incorporate google maps and suggest bbq for upcoming roadtrips. 

### Deliverables
