## Project Name: SetList

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?): 1

#### Project Pitch: An app which takes data from the setlist api and the spotify api which will convert concert setlists to spotify playlists

### Deliverables:

#### Stack: 

#### APIs: setlist.fm api, spotify api

#### Wireframes: https://github.com/kmarler2/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-3/personal-projects/KeelianaM_personalProject_mod3.pdf

#### Waffle & Github:

#### Order Of Attack: Set up and test setlist api call, get result into store. Then build out backend, and finally take result of setlist search and create a new playlist.

#### MVP: App takes in and returns concert setlists

#### Nice To Haves: App adds playlist to spotify, shuffle playlists feature.

#### Biggest Challenges: Building the backend, using multiple apis

#### Instructor Notes:

#### Deliverables for next checkin: Have boilerplate in place, redux, and router set up, initial api call working and adding correct values to store.
