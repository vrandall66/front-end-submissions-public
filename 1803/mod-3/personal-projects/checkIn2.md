Project Name: Love-15;
Check In: 1
- Progress made? User can search for courts, User can create account or log in, user can go to separate create account page.     Current components are tested.
- What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin? None.
- Next Steps? Implement log in and createAccount message. Start adding styling. I may implement local storage to save account   info.
- What are your concerns (if any): Finding a good design. Building a back end(if I get there).

Deliverables for next checkin:
  [] Separate routes for login and search
  [] Style both forms
  [] Add UI for each of the courts
  [] Each court should link to its own component, address should link to a map
  [] Implement firebase authentication for login
