# Game Time
* Students: Haley & Jesse
* Evaluator: Leta

Comments:
* Good class structure
*

### Functional Expectations

pass - 3

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
* 2 - Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
* 1 - Application crashes during normal usage

### User Interface

pass - 3

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.
* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
* 2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
* 1 - The application is confusing or difficult to use.

### Testing

pass - 3

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate. ESLint shows 0 complaints.
* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.
* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested. ESLint shows 5+ complaints.
* 1 - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application. ESLint shows 10+ complaints.

### JavaScript Style

failing - lots of redundancy

* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication. SRP (single responsibility principle) and DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles are utilized. There are _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs.
* 1 - Your client-side application does not function. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps that do not increase clarity.
* 0 - There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

### Application Organization

pass - 3

* 4 - Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) and there are no instances where instructor would suggest moving logic or data to another class. The business-logic code driving functionality is cleanly separated from rendering, view-related code.
* 3 - Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.
* 2 - Application is organized into classes that do not display a good understanding of encapsulation, and logic is not well-divided. Developer cannot articulate what each line of code is doing. There are one or more major bugs.
* 1 - Application is not separated into classes, or methods and properties are illogically assigned to classes. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps that do not increase clarity. Business-side logic and view-related code is not separated at all.

### Workflow

soft pass - 2.5/3

* 4 - The developer/team effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application with descriptive commit messages. The team displays good pairing practices (driver-navigator, dividing up work, etc) and utilizes some sort of planning tool (GitHub issues, Waffle, Trello, etc). The team develops a clear MVP (minimum viable product) and conducts a DTR (define the relationship). Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
* 2 - The developer/team makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application. The team does not utilize a planning tool or equitable pairing practices. One or both members do not contribute meaningfully to the application.
* 1 - The developer/team committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0 - The application was not checked into version control.
