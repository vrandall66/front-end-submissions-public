[happy code](https://github.com/mcnamara14/byob/blob/master/server.js#L45)

Learning how express middleware works and implementing it into the project was a good feeling.

[sad code](https://github.com/mcnamara14/byob/blob/master/server.js#L172)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

At the moment I'm not sure how to refactor the code but because of the length I'm sure it can be.

Anything else you want to say?

Although this project was more time consuming and difficult than I originally imagined I was extremely happy with the outcome and feel like I learned a ton about the backend in general and APIs.
