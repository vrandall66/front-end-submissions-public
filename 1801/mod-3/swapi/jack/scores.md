## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.

### Code Quality

* 2.5 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

### CSS/Design

* 2.5 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad. Attempts to follow 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

* 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

* Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.

### README Updates

* Fail - The boilerplate README is still in place

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 1 - More than ten complaints

### Workflow

* 2 - Developer(s) make large, inconsistent commits that contain irrelevant changesets and make it difficult to follow the evolution of the application. Developer(s) rarely use git branches and frequently incorporate changes directly into master with little or no review process. There are instances of committed source code that should be .gitignored and instances of dead code and/or debugger statements.
