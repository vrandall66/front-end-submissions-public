## Project Name: Spotifive

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?

* Set up firebase (? - at least hosted at try-spotifive.firebaseapp.com)
* Set up Spotify dev account
* Basic app setup (npm start, npm test)
* Landing page w/'Signin with Spotify button'
* 'Signin with Spotify' redirects user to signin with their Spotify account
* If Signin is successful, Spotify redirects back to Authorization component
* Authorization component fetches user info and playlist info
* Playlist fetch checks to see if they have Spotifive playlist already (returning user)
* If no signin error, user is redirected to Search
* 56 tests :tada:

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

* nada

#### Next Steps?

* Search for artist
* Add Spotifive playlist
* Add artists top 5 tracks to playlist
* Test
* Style

#### What are your concerns (if any)

* I don't think I'm doing the Spotify auth correctly 
* Not storing anything in backend
* Not sure I set up firebase correctly

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

* MVP done
* By Friday morning: Search results displayed to user
* By next check-in: click on artist and it will add top 5 songs to Spotifive playlist
