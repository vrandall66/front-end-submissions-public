## Project Name:
Team-up?
#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?

Set up linter
Got user sign in/up with firebase working
Storing users in firebase database
Testing along the way
Keeping Asana up to date
Started building out the UI
Started working with google maps api
Displaying a map and two activities with mock data



#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
Be able to create a new meetup and store it in firebase
Make an initial fetch of those activities and add them to redux store

#### Next Steps?
Build out Create Activity page
Complete deliverables from last checkin
Figure out secondary api to use for that process because google maps needs lat and long
Figure out how to change zip code to lat and long for initial use
Better styling???

Figuring out that secondary api

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
* Create a new meetup, store in the backend, and in redux
