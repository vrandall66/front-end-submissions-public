#### Waffle & Github
Github Issues

#### Order Of Attack
Iteration 0 -  
Setup Firebase  
Render search query to search results page  
Iteration 1 -  
Allow existing users to sign in/sign out  
Allow users to create accounts  
Iteration 2 -  
User functionality: users able to (possibly) download pdfs and archive search results to personal dashboard

#### MVP
Would like to promote others to assist in making science open source by creating an easy to use web application, while helping others get the knowledge they desire.

#### Nice To Haves
Academic Knowledge API https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/en-us/project-academic-knowledge

#### Biggest Challenges
So far just using the API and checking whether or not the results are still available

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

1. Wireframe for user dashboard  
2. Have boilerplate app set up:  
- CRA  
- Router  
- Redux  
3. One API call with return data in Redux store  
4. Search functionality should utilize API call
