[Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/679814972497373/board)
#### Iteration 0
* Set up redux, react.
* Fetch all articles without duplicating data
* Search
  * Users can input words
  * Creates a 'track' which is a group of articles that contain all of the user inputs
  * Users can create multiple tracks
  * Track displays article cards conditionally rendered with political color and priority based on relevance as a news network

#### Iteration 1

* Trending
  * On page load there will be a trending cloud
  * Collection of buttons that are generated by the 10 most popular words in the news excluding (a, an, the, and, etc.).
  * User can click on those buttons to push those words into the search field.
  * On click user can remove them as well

#### Iteration 2

* Storing User Information

#### MVP
* User can search articles and see them displayed side by side with conditional rendering
* Ability to save 'tracks'.

#### Nice To Haves
* Potentially creating login or an ability to share
* Maybe figure out how to make a discussion board

#### Biggest Challenges
* Saving information that is consistently changing

#### Instructor Notes
* Love this idea! Great work so far!

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
* Get Redux set up
* Think about you can incorporate router
* Putting data into Redux store
* Set up Firebase
* Start testing
* Add linter
* Store structure - flat and try not to duplicate data
* Keep Asana up to date with issues
* Start building out the UI
