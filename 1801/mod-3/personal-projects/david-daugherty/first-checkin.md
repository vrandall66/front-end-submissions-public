## Project Name: SPORTSBALL

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?)
Numero uno
#### Project Pitch
Whether we like it or not knowing about sports is one of the most common small talk conversation starters around. On a daily basis people all over the world are sucked into conversations about the big game last night all to disapoint their coworkers when they realize you couldn't care less about the big game. Sportsball is here to help change that disapointment by giving you (the sports uneducated) the tools and basic conversation pieces to get you through those hard awkward moments and fool your watercooler bretheren about the game last night.

### Deliverables
An idea, wireframes and an api that I will be using.
#### Stack:
React, Redux, Router, maybe firebase, maybe some sort of animation library.
#### APIs:
[Sportradar](https://developer.sportradar.com/API_Packaging#Feed_packages) or [mysports feeds](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/)
#### Wireframes

#### Waffle & Github

#### Order Of Attack
I really want to really develop a strong road map by wireframing and annotating how everything is going to work together, look and feel so that I an able to eliminate an much potential hurdles as possible. My next step will be figuring out how I will need to clean the data and creating a large data set of phrases while testing along the way. 
#### MVP
I want to be able to have the user login and favorite a team to follow, then I want to app to give the user an indication as to whether their team won or lost in some sort of fun way that allows for a conversation starter like 'They got crushed last night. Also have a sentance that give a vague event that happened during the game like "Did you see that guys homerun? I would also like to really push my creative/design/UX/UI abilities with this project since that is a strength I would really like to highlight for potential employers.


#### Nice To Haves
Adding more data and apis that link to teaching about terminology of the game. Original icon and illustration work and use of javascript animations/Parallax. Branch out to other sports other than baseball.

#### Biggest Challenges
I think the biggest challenge will be figuring out the logic to display a correct applicable response for events that happened during the game.
