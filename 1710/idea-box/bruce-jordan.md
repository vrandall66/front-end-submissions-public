## Student: Bruce and Jordan
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- buggy behavior
- quality value disappears in some user cases? unclear what causes it
- can still create an idea with nothing in the inputs. details matter, and this is not a small detail.
- no disabled state on button
- very tidy, clean codebase
- CSS uses percentages for height, use a different unit of measure. This can cause very unpredictable behavior/movement/scaling as a user resize the browser window and when you are building more complex UI it will be a major headache.
- used no classes, only ids being used in HTML -- not flexible or modular as ids cannot be reused on a page.
- UI needs a lot of work. was built at 150% zoom, and is not well executed when it is viewed at 100%.

## Functional Expectations

* Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.


## HTML

### Accessibility

* Novice  Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.


### Style

* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.


## CSS

### Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.


### Implementation

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.



## JAVASCRIPT

### Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.


### Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.


### Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.


### Arrays

* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.


### Objects & Prototypes

* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

### DOM Manipulation


### Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.


## GIT & GITHUB

### Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
* Exceptional Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers.

### Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.



## DESIGN

### Comp Recreation

* Novice  Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details.
* Advanced Beginner Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.


## PAIRING

### Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
* Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.
