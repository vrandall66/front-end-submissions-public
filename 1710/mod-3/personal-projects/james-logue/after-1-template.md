## Project Name:

#### Check In: 1

#### Progress made?
Waffle is set up and issues have been added, landing page is built but not styled. Redux store functionality is up and running but only passing mock data. Built backend for dealing with Watson, and am successfully getting responses from the API. The Front End is able to fetch from the back end, but I still need to connect that post request to the call/response from Watson. Linting and Testing are set up, but need write tests as functionality is built. 

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

I need to update the wireframes, add additional helper functions to clean data for render.

#### Next Steps?

Pass data from backend to frontend, wireframe and style. Create components for dynamic rendering.

#### What are your concerns (if any)

Just glad I got the initial fetch working!!

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
