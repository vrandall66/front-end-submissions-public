## Project Name:

  - Farmers Market Finder

#### Check In: 
  - Number one

#### Project Pitch

  - I struggle finding a valid organic farmers market or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture). I would like to make an app that takes out the hassle of when and where Farmers markets are at and what products that they have. My app would be able to take a zip code and show you the closest farmers markets to your location. by clicking on the location you like it will show you the details of that farmers market.

### Deliverables

  - react
  - redux
  - router
  
#### APIs:

  - the US Department of Agriculture, farmers market directory API

  - build front page with with the components
  - buildin Router and create a goto page when zip-code is submited

#### MVP
