## Project Name: Blend

#### Check In: 2

#### Progress made?

React, Router and Redux are all set up.  Have built out a user input form.  This form takes the user input string and then fetches ingredients from the api based on the user input string.  The response from the server is being sent to the the Redux store.  Learned my way around the api and familiarized myself with the docs for the api. 

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?

The testing suite needs to be expanded, this is my current focus before building more features. I am not populating the redux store without ruining my app.

#### Next Steps?

I would like to fully test all features that have been build.  

I want to fetch all data from the api and then filter just the names of the items. I will then store this filtered data in my app because it does not change.  I then want to put those names into my complete me project and build a trie.  The trie will be used to suggest ingredients which are in the api to the user.  

I want to display the results after a user search being sent to the store visually to the user.

#### What are your concerns (if any)

I would like to go over error handling and how you would like to see it implemented. 

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
