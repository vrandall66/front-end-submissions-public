#### Check In 1

#### Project Pitch

Have you ever caught yourself walking somewhere hearing music, and notice that you've started walking to the rhythm of the song? Step to the Beat takes that concept and flips it!

  - Manual test (walk and count)
  - Height and speed
  (- Using Pedometer/Accelerometer)
3) User sign in
4) Save User info
  - Save SPM's by user
  - Save favorite songs
  - Save favorite Playlists
5) Favorite Songs/Lists
6) Persist data
