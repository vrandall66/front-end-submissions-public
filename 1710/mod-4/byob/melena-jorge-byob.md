# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/byob/blob/master/server.js#L147-L155)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
We used a generator to paginate the organism responses! It was cool to implement that concept.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/byob/blob/master/server.js#L23-L39)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
This is a really messy series of nested ifs/ternaries. There were a lot of scenarios to consider and making it less verbose was challenging.
