## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I was not able to complete a few of the requirement of the spec. When save palette is clicked the saved palette goes to the backend but does not render to the page immediately, same goes for save project. Save project does append to the select menu right away.  Delete removes the palette from the backend but does not trigger a re-render.  Also you cannot click a prior projects palette to render in the main display. I did not attempt to solve these issues and prioritized other problems. All endpoints are functional.  My testing suite is weak and needs to be further developed. Although I did not finish I am proud of how close I came to finishing. I will address all of these issues.  

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

none 

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/PreciseSlice/palette-picker/blob/5121d899deac98e034313eb24b62b740669936fb/public/js/scripts.js#L71-L126)

I am proud of this section because it was an intestine logic problem and took a fair amount of effort to solve.  Had to think deeply about what order events needed to occur and the context within the function. I would like to think about refactoring this section and making it even better. I also enjoyed learning new framworks and revisiting jquery.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/PreciseSlice/palette-picker/blob/5121d899deac98e034313eb24b62b740669936fb/test/routes.spec.js#L1-L108)

I selected testing because I would like my test suit to be much stronger.  I would also like to clean up and refactor my jquery. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

I viewed color mind multiple times because I wanted to see something other than coolers. I would like to implement some sort of animation for the palette. I tinkered with some query animation methods over break.  I did not work on animations because I did not feel it was a priority. I skimmed through dribble a few times did not use anything specific.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I had fun doing this project and really enjoyed learning about and building relational databases. I am looking forward to learning more about building api’s and databases. I will continue to improve this site and get it fully functional. Many in the class came together and worked very hard on this project. Thank you for teaching me about these new concepts and answering my questions.
