## Project Name:

Get Yours

#### Check In: 1


#### Project Pitch

I was thinking about what I could do and decided insead of solving a problem for just myself I would try an help some others as well. I chose the amazon affilaite app for a few reasons. I ad a thought that any kind of site partnering with a large innovative firm is a good thing for future employers to see. It will show that I can work with large data sets to mine the data I am looking for. Also I will be able to incorporate React, React-Router and Redux into the flow. I would probably pick some obscure data sets to start unless there are some suggestions
