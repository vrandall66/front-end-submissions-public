#### Project Pitch

Being in education the past 8 years, I have learned that one of the greatest indicators of student success is parent involvement. My experiences have shown me that it is extremely rare to find a parent that truly doesn't care. The vast majority of parents would love to be involved, but schools often create barriers to entry without realizing it. My app seeks to overcome some of those barriers by creating a tool for teachers to efficiently communicate about a student's behavior throughout the school day. The app will allow a teacher to add a point to a student, based on a positive behavior, which will immediately trigger a ping to the parent or guardian of that child. I can vouch that 10 times out of 10 a student would rather have a positive note home than candy anyday. This app will improve classroom behavior while also eliminating the communication gap between parents and teachers.

#### Waffle & Github

#### Order Of Attack
* Planning on waffle
* Map out/ backwards plan project to determine personal deadlines
* Get really comfortable with Twilio

#### MVP
* Teachers can attach parent contact information to each student.
* Teachers can give students points based on 4-8 different character traits.
* Parent receives a text each time their student earns a point.
* Teachers can set point minimums to control how often texts are sent. 

#### Nice To Haves
* Student points are tracked over time. 
* Teachers can drag and drop students based on seating charts.
* Teachers can add an optional message before the text is sent. 

#### Biggest Challenges
* Backend?
* Need to think through how information is being stored
* Need to dig into the Twilio API
