# Basics

#### Link to the GitHub Repository for the Project
[palette-picker](https://github.com/nicktu12/palette-picker)

#### Link to the Deployed Application
[heroku](https://nt-palettepicker-171201.herokuapp.com/)

#### Link to your annotated server file
[annotated server file](https://github.com/nicktu12/palette-picker/blob/master/server.js)
I accidentally pushed my annotated file to my master branch at 2 a.m. last night. Whoops!

## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes! Base functionality for the application is complete according to project spec. While I was able to successful setup a test environment, I only completed successful tests for one GET endpoint and one POST endpoint. Additionally, the front end is incomplete but all UI interactions are present. 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/nicktu12/palette-picker/blob/master/server.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

While not excited about commented out code in the server file, I feel like I learned a lot from building a backend and am very excited to be able to walk through the process of building a backend step by step. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/nicktu12/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Code is not well factored. Using a mix of es5 and es6 syntax. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

https://codepen.io/TrevorWelch/pen/NwERXE

I wanted to create a ripple effect on the palettes when locked. While I wasn't able to create the ripple at the location of the mouse quick, I was able to quickly implement a knock-off version of the effect. 

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Really enjoyed learning back-end projects as I was building the project. I felt very strongly about solidifying concepts of the back-end through building one for this project. I am disappointed with my progress on my design and testing, but and happy to have successfully intergrated all user interactions to the front end and wrote a passing GET and POST test.
