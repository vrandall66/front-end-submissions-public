# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/lfinney/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/index.js#L159-#L166)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
This was one of the last pieces of functionalty that I wrote. I was able to put it together quite quickly, and it's clean and concise.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/lfinney/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/index.js#L17-#L37)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
Ideally, I would not like to have this much html in a js file. Initially, I tried to keep the html in the index.html file as a template and create a new copy as needed. I ran into problems with styling and appending the proper data from the database.

Now that I have a bit more experience with jQuery and better understand the server-client relationship, I think I could get my intial idea to work.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

As a general rule, I like matte colors and simple designs. [Color Hunt by Gal Shir] (https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/729829/screenshots/3845170/galshir-colorhunt.gif) displays colors in succession using no borders. I tried to style my app without using any borders, but instead relying on the contrasting colors to "draw" the sharp lines for one's eye. ~I also experimented with adding some drop shadow, which Gal also does, but couldn't quite get it to look as I wanted. I tried attempting to use whites and grays to contrast the black palette of my overall app, but all the colors I attempted didn't look to pleasing to the eye.~ Added the drop shadow and just went with a darker black. It makes the page containers less flat.
