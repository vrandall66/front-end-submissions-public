## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Yes, I completed all base functionality.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

I completed the extension to be able to edit the hex of a color.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code]()

* Q: Why were you proud of this piece of code?
* A: I like this because I think that using a dynamic ID is way easier than I thought it would be. I feel like this is as
clean as it could possibly be.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code]()

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
* I feel instead of making all 5 of these divs individually, I could iterate through and create each DIV. But I struggled to run a for loop inside of the html.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it
* I used http://www.yeticycles.com/ I really like their primary colors, their buttons and their header.  I find the color and cleanliness of their appealing.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

The lessons in class so far have been written extremely well and they are easy to follow.  They made getting through this project a lot less stressful along with helping me learn.
