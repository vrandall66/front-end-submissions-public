# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/palette-picker/blob/c84bcd40d2bd24bd5e7d4bb282643a45fbc10bb7/public/js/scripts.js#L107-L160)


i really like when it all comes together and displays on the dom. its always satisfying feeling.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/johnmboudreaux/palette-picker/blob/c84bcd40d2bd24bd5e7d4bb282643a45fbc10bb7/public/js/scripts.js#L134-L160)

I know i put some of this as the code that im proud of, but i do really like the functionality of it. i 
just think it could be written cleaner and not look so bulky.
