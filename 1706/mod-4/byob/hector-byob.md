# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of

[happy code](https://github.com/hsanchez7934/hs-build-your-own-backend/blob/master/db/seeds/dev/watches.js)
Lines 4 through 25 functions createBrands and createWatch

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
Took me a while to figure out how to seed the large data set that I'm using.
The first few functions that I wrote were long and sloppy but in the end I was able to end up with a few lines
of code and the functions work the way I want them to.
