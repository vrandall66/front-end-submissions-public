### Specification Adherence

* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all iterations above and implements one or 
  more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.
* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal
  recommendations for design changes.
* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing part of one or more of the 
  features outlined above. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design

### Project Professionalism

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, codebase has zero linter errors/warnings and
  readme contains screenshots of application. Project team uses a rebase
  workflow, taking advantage of github issues to track work. Project shows a
  complete mastery of React architecture.
* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.
* 2 - Project is missing PropTypes, README updates, wireframes, or has more
  than 5 linter errors. Project team makes large infrequent git commits.
  Project shows a basic understanding of React.
* 1 - PropTypes are substantially unused, README is incomplete, wireframes were
  not used, or more than 10 linter errors are present. Git history does not show
  evolution of project, with many large and inconsistent commits. Project shows
  little understanding of React and significant refactoring is required.

### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are
  passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).
* 3 - All requirements from 2 are met and a valid attempt to test asynchronous functionality has been made.
* 2 - Nearly all unit tests are in place. No attempt to test async functionality was made.
* 1 - A valid attempt to test this application was made, but there are obvious gaps, with missing unit tests.


### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for
  rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for
  undefined routes.
* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
* 2 - Application uses React Router, but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.
* 1 - Application uses React Router, but does not render/use all routes.
