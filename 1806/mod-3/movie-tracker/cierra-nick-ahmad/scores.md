### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 1 - A valid attempt to test this application was made, but there are obvious
  gaps, with missing unit tests for Redux and React.

### Redux Architecture

* 2 - At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
