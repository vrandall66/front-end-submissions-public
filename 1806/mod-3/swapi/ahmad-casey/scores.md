## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### React Router

- 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### Testing

- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### Wireframes

- Pass - Developer team laid out their thinking using wireframes before building their project

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

- 4 - Zero complaints
- 3 - Five or fewer complaints
- 2 - Six to ten complaints
- 1 - More than ten complaints

### Workflow

- 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.
