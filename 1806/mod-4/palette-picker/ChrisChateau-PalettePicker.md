[happy code](https://github.com/christopherchateau/palette-picker/blob/master/db/seeds/dev/projects.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Running a migration and properly seeding the database is something that was especially rewarding because it was all new material for me.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/christopherchateau/palette-picker/blob/master/server.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I wrote my fetch requests using async/await, but did not use that syntax in the server.js file. When I have more time, I'd like to refactor server.js using async/await.
