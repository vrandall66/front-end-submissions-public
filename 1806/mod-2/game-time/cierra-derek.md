# Game Time
* Students: Cierra & Derek
* Evaluator: Brittany


Comments:
* Many opportunities for refactoring, removing dead or unused code, and making long if/else conditions a bit more readable
* Some instances where methods and properties are on the wrong classes and should be moved to a more appropriate place
* Seemed to have a difficult pairing with working styles/collaborating on solving problems
* Worked really hard to get changes in over the weekend

### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

* Scores on the DOM aren't in the best spot, and text is tiny in comparison to the rest of the game

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing. ESLint shows < 5 complaints.

### JavaScript Style & OOP

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application is organized into classes (and correctly uses inheritance) with some misplaced logic and no major bugs. Business-logic code is mostly separated from view-related code. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what each line of code is doing.



### Workflow

* 3 - The developer/team makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. The team conducts a DTR (define the relationship) and utilizes a planning tool and pairing practices. Both members contribute meaningfully to the application.
